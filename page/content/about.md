# About Me

Hi, I’m Adam. I’m a Senior Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) with a focus on making software reliable and user-friendly.

I started my career back in 2018 as a Game Tester at Lionbridge, chasing down bugs on platforms like the Xbox. Later, at Vewd Software, I moved from manual testing into automation, which set me on the SDET path.

Now I’m at TiVo, working on both manual and automated testing, mainly with Python and Linux. I enjoy digging into problems, improving processes, and making sure the products people use every day actually work the way they should.
