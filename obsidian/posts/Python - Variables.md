Variables are one of the most fundamental part of Python. Due to Python's dynamic nature and simplicity we often don't think much about how do they work. In this article I would like show and explain what are and how variables works.

1. [[#Beginners]]

## Beginners

In most of the situation to create variable you need to use equal sign `=` to assign a value to the name.

For example:

```python
message = "Hello World!"
```

From now on, python creates a variable named `message` and you can access the variable value by referring to its name.

Variable definition in programming is a procedure when we create a relation between name and value. From now on, we can access the value called variable value by using name called variable name.

There are few reasons to declare variable:
- To re-use specific value multiple times
- To give the value meaning

In most of the cases variables definition happens when you assign a value (with `=` symbol) to a variable name.
